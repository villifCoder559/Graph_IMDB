# Graph_IMDB
From a dataset of movies extract all data, create a graph using Networkx, and resolve the following exercises:
1.  Which is the movie with the largest number of actors, considering only the movies up to year x= {1930,1940,1950,1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020}?
2.  Considering only the movies up to year x ={1930,1940,1950,1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020} and restricting to the largest connected component of the graph. Compute exactly the diameter of G
3.  Which is the movie with the largest number of popular actors, i.e. such that the sum of the number of movies its actors participated in is maximum?
4.  Build also the actor graph, whose nodes are only actors and two actors are connected if they did a movie together, which is the pair of actors who collaborated the most among themselves?
